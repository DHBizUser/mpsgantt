;; Snippets to develop and compile this project. Its part of my general deployment workflow that depends on some lisp outside this project. Similar to a makefile.

;; this file is meant to be opened in an emacs buffer and expressions evaluated as needed, not in strict order.


;; all the other files in the repo are the bricks. This is the mortar.




;;  process to run the report --> timed it at  15:24.91  --- on 2025-07-18
;; this is with no hiccups -- some manual steps arranging the source data and directing the scripts to the correct locations on disk.

TODO:

- create a SQL test to catch a new or missed work center that came up on CM01 but isnt in the WorkCenter table on test-cm01-data.db
   if new Work Centers are created in the system, will SAPgrab.vbs pull them in?

- make the x axis major tics in one-month intervals with darker grid lines and labels for every month.
    Try iso week interval for minor tics, unlabeled

- verify WorkCenter table classification with SME

- classify the requirement types with colors to distinguish firm and forecast. using an index in the SQL.

- ?? map the BOMreport paths to the CM01 schedule [order, material, or line level?] and try to show those relationships in the plot.

- establish a benchmark chart that aligns to the month commitment process. Measure movement off of that using a simple animation or swipe
   mechanism

- write a .bat file or powershell script to run the whole pull-down and update process with less fiddling.
